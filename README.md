**ValueInfinity MVP**

Consists of the main Node and Express JS project, with Express proving the backend features, and the React app for the front end.


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This uses concurrently (https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to start both the Node app and the React app, instead of starting them in separate windows in development.

Also using Material-UI for React components.
